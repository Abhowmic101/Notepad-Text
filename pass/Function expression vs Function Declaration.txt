The main difference between a function expression and a 
function declaration is the function name, which can be 
omitted in function expressions to create anonymous 
functions. A function expression can be used as an IIFE 
(Immediately Invoked Function Expression) which runs as 
soon as it is defined.

In short, use function declarations when you want to 
create a function on the global scope and make it 
available throughout your code. Use function expressions 
to limit where the function is available, keep your 
global scope light, and maintain clean syntax.
