Abstraction is commonly defined as the extraction of 
relevant information from a larger data set, where 
utilizing abstraction allows engineers and others to 
simplify a codebase.

The reason this is confusing to many people is that 
abstraction doesn't “sound like” what it is, semantically. It sounds like making something more vague, because 
that's how we use it in general language.
