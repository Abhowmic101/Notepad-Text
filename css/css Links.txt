One additional attribute that’s supported by the <a> tag is the rel attribute, which is used
to describe the relationship between the linking document and the document that the user
is linking to. There’s a set of specific values that should be used with this attribute. The
most well known is the nofollow attribute, which indicates that search engines should
not factor that link into their ranking of the document that is linked. nofollow is intended
as a measure to fight search engine spam. You would use it like this:
<a href="http://www.example.com/" rel="nofollow">Link to example site</a>
