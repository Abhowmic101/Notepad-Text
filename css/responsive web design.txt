To make a page responsive you have to set all the elements properties to 
box-sizing:border-box
it will help to keep the size of elements fixed.

#Don't use large fixed width elements.
Don't use image wider than viewport otherwise it will scroll horizontally.
#Don't let the content rely on a particular viewport width.
to render well.

#use Css media queries to apply different styling for pages.
Using larger width can be foolish.it can create or cross 
the maximum width of the viewport on smaller devices.
