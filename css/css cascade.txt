With CSS, the styles that are applied to a given element
 are calculated from all the selectors that match that 
style in the style sheet.It’s also possible to override styles. 

There are two kinds of length units: absolute and relative. Absolute units theoretically
correspond to a unit of measure in the real world, such as an inch, a centimeter, or a
point. Relative units are based on some more arbitrary unit of measure.
Using Percentage Units

When you use percentages as units , bear in mind that the percentage applies not
to the size of the page, but rather to the size of the box that encloses the box to
which the style applies. For example, if you have a <div> with its width set to 50%
inside a <div> with its width set to 500px, the inner <div> will be 250 pixels wide.
However, if the outer <div> were also set to 50%, it would be half as wide as the
browser window, and the inner <div> would be 25% of the width of the browser window 
CSS3 also brings in three new relative units that are very useful: rem, vh, and vw. The
rem unit acts like the em unit; it is relative to the font size. But rather than being relative
to the current element’s font size, it’s relative to the base font size for the whole page.
This means that you can set values that don’t combine with each other. Many designers
did not like the em unit because it would combine and result in font sizes that were much
larger or smaller than they expected. rem acts the way most designers expect.
The other two new units are vh and vw. These are relative to the viewport window. This is
particularly useful if you are designing pages to look good on mobile and smaller screen
