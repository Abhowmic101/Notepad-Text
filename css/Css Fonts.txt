font-weight property:
In some cases, computers will have a bold variation of a font, an
italic variation, and a normal variation but not a bold, italic variation. 
If you specify that text has a font-weight of bold and a
font-style of italic or oblique, the browser will substitute an
oblique version of the bold font that it creates on the fly, and the
result will often be ugly text. If you are concerned with nice typography, 
make sure to only specify font variations that are normally
installed.
l. To specify that text should be boldface, the
font-weight property is used. Valid values are normal (the default), bold , bolder,
lighter, and 100 through 900, in units of 100. Its best to use values 
in 100s units. like font-weight:700;
