Why-100vw-causes-horizontal-scrollbar?

Ans:Most of the times, I always find the 100vw value on 
the width that is the cause of the overflow. So, if that
is the case, you can try replacing it with width: 100% instead
and see if it works. Try with its inner elements as well
if present.
So, back to the title, why would 100vw be the cause? Well,
the answer is:

When you set an element's width to 100vw, the element's 
width now will be the whole view width of the browser and
 the important part is 100vw does not include the 
vertical scrollbar's width into its calculation at all. 
Therefore, when there is a vertical scrollbar, the total
width will be the sum of the element's width and the vertical
scrollbar's width, which causes the overflow on the 
x-axis and thus the horizontal scrollbar.
