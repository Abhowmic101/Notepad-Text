Global carbon emissions from fossil fuels have significantly increased since 1900. Since 1970, CO2 emissions have increased by about 90%, with emissions from fossil fuel combustion and industrial processes contributing about 78% of the total greenhouse gas emissions increase from 1970 to 2011.
Concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have increased since the beginning of the industrial era. Almost all of this increase is attributable to human activities.

In 2019, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions totaled 6,558 million metric tons (14.5 trillion pounds) of carbon dioxide equivalents. This total represents a 2 percent increase since 1990 but a 12 percent decrease since 2005 
So even though carbon output was down last year, the increase in the level in the atmosphere was still bigger than the average between 2011-2020. According to the WMO's annual Greenhouse Gas Bulletin, CO2 reached 413.2 parts per million in the atmosphere in 2020 and is now 149% of the pre-industrial level.

Modern Economists believe that industrialization is creating
opportunities for us to lead a better life. Moreover,they believe it is not harming environment to the degree that is 
claimed by environmentalist.
