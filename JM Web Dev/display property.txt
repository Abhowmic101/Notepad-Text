Inline property doesn't take top and bottom margin. But
takes left and right margin.

Block Property acts as block takes the full width of the 
line.

Inline-block property makes property inline but let them to
set width and height.

Compared to display: inline, the major difference is that
display: inline-block allows to set a width and height on
the element.

Also, with display: inline-block, the top and bottom 
margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline
they are not.

Compared to display: block, the major difference is that
display: inline-block does not add a line-break after the
element, so the element can sit next to other elements.
