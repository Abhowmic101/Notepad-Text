Two types of Units:
Relative Units
Absolute Units

root element: like html tag developer sets or default in browser.
em:relative to parents font-size
rem:relative to root element font-size.

em creates problem sometime because it takes the size
of its parent that's when we set an elements size relative
to it's parents it takes the size of its parent then if you
set its childs size with em it's child take the size of it.
