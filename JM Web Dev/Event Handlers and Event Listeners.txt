To react to an event, you attach an event handler to it.
This is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function 
that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event
fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in 
response to an event, we say we are registering an event
handler. Note: Event handlers are sometimes called event
listeners â€” they are pretty much interchangeable for our 
purposes, although strictly speaking, they work together.
The listener listens out for the event happening, and the
handler is the code that is run in response to it 
happening.
