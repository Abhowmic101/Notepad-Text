‘Happiness resides not in possessions, and not in gold, happiness dwells in the soul.’
—Democritus

Behind the smiles, everyone is going through personal struggles we know nothing about.

humility.’

We must find positivity in the bleakest situations and live by the principle of gratitude.

teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean . . . and we were taught to value
everyone’s contribution and treat everyone with respect.’
—Michelle Obama
