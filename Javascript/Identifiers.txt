In Javascript, Identifiers are used to name variables(and keywords, 
and functions, and labels).
The rules for legal names are much the same in most programming 
languages.
In JavaScript, the first character must be a letter, or an underscore (_), or a dollar sign ($).

Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

Numbers are not allowed as the first character.
This way JavaScript can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.
All JavaScript identifiers are case sensitive.
JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
