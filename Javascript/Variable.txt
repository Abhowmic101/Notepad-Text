generally computer takes input as a string to use it as 
integer or float use parseInt/float() to converrt  it
 into integer or float.

Variable should be identified by unique names.
These unique names are called identifiers.

The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:

Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Names must begin with a letter
Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names
JavaScript identifiers are case-sensitive.
Using the dollar sign is not very common in JavaScript, but professional programmers often use it as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library.

In the JavaScript library jQuery, for instance, the main function $ is used to select HTML elements. In jQuery $("p"); means "select all p elements".

Using the underscore is not very common in JavaScript, 
but a convention among professional programmers is to 
use it as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.


The let keyword was introduced in ES6 (2015).

Variables defined with let cannot be Redeclared.

Variables defined with let must be Declared before use.

Variables defined with let have Block Scope.

Variables declared with let cannot be redeclared.
But variables declared with let can be redeclared outside 
the block.
like
{
let x=2;
}

let x=4;

is valid.
