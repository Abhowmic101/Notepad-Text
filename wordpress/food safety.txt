The danger zone refers to temperatures between 41 and 135 degrees Fahrenheit. For time- and temperature-sensitive foods such as meat, poultry, eggs, and dairy, it’s imperative that you keep internal temperatures either above or below the danger zone.

Cold foods should be stored or held at below 41 degrees, while hot foods need to be held 140 degrees or above. As a general rule, these temperature sensitive foods should not stay in the danger zone for more than 2 hours. During this time, dangerous bacteria can grow and spread


How to Practice Food Safety in Self-Service Areas

While employees of your restaurant or buffet may have adequate food safety knowledge, it’s safe to assume your patrons will not. Because of this, self-service areas are especially susceptible to contamination.

Frequently clean and sanitize surfaces including serving utensils, food storage containers, sneeze guards, and countertops.
Provide flatware, napkin, and straw dispensers designed to dispense single-use items.
For added sanitation, provide packets of wrapped flatware to reduce the chance of contamination.
Assign employees to monitor guests and take corrective action in the event that unsafe practices have occurred.
