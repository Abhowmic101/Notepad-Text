Quantitative data can be thought of as information that 
can be transcribed numerically. Think about survey data,
 we can put it into spreadsheets. We can then analyze it
 using descriptive statistics. We can find out things 
like what's the average age of the user in the study, 
what was the median number of years that that user had 
their current phone?
