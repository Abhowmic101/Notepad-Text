Qualitative data, on the other hand, is more easily 
thought of as providing us with Thematic information.
An example of qualitative data is information gathered 
from interviews with users. The information you collect 
will more easily be put into a narrative than into 
spreadsheets, imagine that you interviewed 15 people 
about the reasons they got a new smartphone. Is likely 
that we can start to see commonalities in the categories
 or themes that lead them to their decision to get a new
phone.

Is one type a data better than the other? No, they both 
give us different and important information, I've heard 
colleagues say that quantitative data gives us the what 
about the user and qualitative data give us the why.
